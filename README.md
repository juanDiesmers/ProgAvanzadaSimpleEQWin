Sound wave equalizer for university project with the help of JUCE framework

This plug-in is a proyect that has as a main objective show to students how waves 
can be interpreted by a computer, and thus modify frequencies. All of this with the main vision
of using our knowledge and tools we've learned during the course of advanced coding to 
formulate and interpretate tools with useful and creative properties, making the whole process
a part of which we can learn how to apply and use variables to our favor.

This tool can identify and graph waves that can be modified, changing it's properties and
the way in which they behave, making it useful even for musicians. Even though we are using the guide
of FreeCodeCamp, we are making modifications and notations that can be used to 
make our proyect a demonstration to accomplish the goals and objectives previously defined.
In this way, we can not learn but also understand how each one of the objects mentioned in the video work
and thus making it more of a whole experience that can be enjoyed.
